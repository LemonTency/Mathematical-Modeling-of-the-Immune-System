# Mathematical-Modeling-of-the-Immune-System
Every biological organism, has an immune system which protects him against the attacks of antigens (antigens are pathogen microorganisms). The immune system protects the biological organism, assisted by his "soldiers" called antibodies(elementary units of the immune system). The problem is that the number antibodies, is just a mere percentage of the total number of antigens (For about 10^24 species of antigens, there are just 10^8 species of antibodies). As a concequence, each species of antibodies, has to encounter more than one species of antigens and vice versa.  This project is based on genetic algorithms.More specifically, using MATLAB, once created antigen bank (pathogens bank), the genetic algorithm evolves the population of antibodies and finally finds how they are formed in order to be as complementary as possible with the different species of antigens.
